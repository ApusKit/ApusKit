# ApusKit

**A Swift-native agent harness — a reimplementation of Mario Zechner's pi**

ApusKit is an open-source Swift framework for building AI agents into
Apple-platform apps and command-line tools. It is a faithful Swift
reimplementation of the core of the **pi coding agent**
([earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), MIT) — the same
battle-tested loop semantics and session format — delivered as a modular kit
for the Apple ecosystem.

Consumers inject their own providers through public protocols; the library
never hardcodes a vendor.

## Status

**Current status: 🔨 M0 in progress — package skeleton, core message/event types, `ScriptedProvider` and the agent loop landed with a green local `swift test` (2026-08-25); CI workflows not yet live, so the M0 gate stays un-flipped pending a link to a passing CI run (PROG-2).**
